    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, add the peas
                and process until coarse.
                Transfer to a bowl and cover with
                cold water.<br> The skins will float
                to the top; scoop them out and discard.
                Allow peas to soak for 8 hours. Drain the water.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In the food processor, add the soaked peas and half the chopped onion.
                Blend until it turns into a paste.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer to a large mixing bowl; season with salt and mix with a wooden spoon until the volume doubles.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a blender, add the shrimp, coconut milk, peanuts, cashews, remaining chopped onion, manioc flour and ginger.<br> Blend until well combined, then transfer to a pan. Season with salt.
                Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring so it doesn't thicken.<br> Add some drops of palm oil, just enough to give it color and flavor. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In a deep-sided pan, add palm oil. Place the half onion in the pan to gauge cooking temperature.
                Place spoonfuls of the<br> shrimp mixture in the oil, and let it fry until it's golden on both sides.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove from oil and allow to cool slightly. Slice in half; stuff with pea mixture, salsa and shrimp.
            </li>
        </ol>
